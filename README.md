# Cat Stacker Source Code
 This is the repo for the open source code of Cat Stacker. This is NOT official, but it is the official source code. It contains as many versions of the game that I can find. DM me on Discord if you know any versions that aren't 1.6 or 1.8 (COMING SOON)

# HOW TO RUN/INSTALL

1. Download any version source of your choosing from it's dedicated branch (For this example, we're using 1.8, make sure to unzip it!!!)

1. Download/Open Visual Studio Code

2. Install the "Live Server" plugin (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

3. Open the source you installed in Visual Studio Code

4. Right click the index.html and select Open With Live Server

5. Once it opens, your default browser should open to the game. Congrats, the game should've launched! If not, submit an issue and include screenshots of your Chrome console.

# Creating/Uploading mods

If you make a mod for the game, DM me on Discord.

NOTE: The game is made in Phaser 2, so you should use Phaser 2's documentation to make mods if you don't know it. Phaser works off JavaScript. Happy modding!

DOUBLE NOTE: If you want to add a module to it, DONT use JavaScript import. Add the module to the node_modules folder and reference it in the index.html file in this format: <script src="./node_modules/YOURMODULE/mainjavascriptfile.js"></script>

You won't need to use import if you do it this way.
